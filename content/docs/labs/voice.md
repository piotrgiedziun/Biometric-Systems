# Voice biometrics

Identification and voice recognition are issues that have a number of practical applications in automation, authentication and security. It is a popular method of remote authorization thanks to its non-invasive and accessibility (e.g. telephone, personal computer). This method combines physical and behavioral elements. It uses a person's acoustic features, which are shaped by biological features (e.g. the shape of the larynx) and by additional behavioral features such as stress, rhythm, intonation and vocabulary selection.
